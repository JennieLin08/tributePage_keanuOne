        <p class="tribute-info">Keanu Charles Reeves is a Canadian actor. Born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, Reeves began acting in theatre productions and in television films before making his feature film debut in Youngblood. He had his breakthrough role in the science fiction comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, and he reprised his role in its sequels.</p> 
       

<p>Describing himself as a "private kid", Reeves attended four different high schools, including the Etobicoke School of the Arts, from which he was expelled. Reeves said he was expelled because he was "just a little too rambunctious and shot my mouth off once too often... I was not generally the most well-oiled machine in the school". Reeves has dyslexia and has said, "Because I had trouble reading, I wasn't a good student". At De La Salle College, he was a successful ice hockey goalkeeper. Reeves had aspirations to become a professional ice hockey player for the Canadian Olympic team but decided to become an actor when he was 15. After leaving De La Salle College, he attended Avondale Secondary Alternative School, which allowed him to get an education while working as an actor. He dropped out of high school when he was 17. He obtained a green card through his American stepfather and moved to Los Angeles three years later. Reeves holds only Canadian citizenship. </p>

<p>Keanu reportedly gave 70 per cent of his $35m earnings for 1999’s The Matrix to leukaemia research after his sister, Kim, was diagnosed with the disease. He also set up a leading children’s charity, the Keanu Reeves Children Foundation, which has changed the lives of more than a billion kids around the world.</p>
